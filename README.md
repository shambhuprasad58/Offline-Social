Offline-Social
==============

A windows phone 8 app to post status updates to facebook, twitter and linkedin when app is in background. In absence of a persistent internet, user can save their status updates in this app and it will post the status as soon as the network comes. Windows phone OS inherently does not allow an app to run in background except at a 30 minutes interval. I have bypassed this by using background file transfer service.
